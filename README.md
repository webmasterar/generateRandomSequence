# generateRandomSequence

A utility to generate random DNA/Protein sequences and output them to a file.

Use the flags _fans_ to run the program. All the command line options can be seen using the _-h_ flag. The _n_ flag accepts scientific notation such as 1e6 for 1 million.

Here is an example of how to run this utility:

`python generateRandomSequence.py -f 1mb.fasta -a DNA -n 1e6 -s seq1`
